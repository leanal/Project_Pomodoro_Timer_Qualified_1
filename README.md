# Pomodoro Timer

[App Demo](https://project-pomodoro-timer-qualified-1-zeta.vercel.app/)

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

Built with **JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS**.
